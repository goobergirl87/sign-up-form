# sign-up-form

This straight forward project is part of the HTML/CSS intermediate course of the Odin Project. It teaches you how to build a clean form, but it dives also into the difficulties of building a form, the parts that are less easy to style. Additionally TOP gives ressources that go further into UX, cause in the end the form is the most interactive part in a website, so you want to make sure, that the user has a fluent experience.
